        Purpose:    This is called each time a user clicks the mouse button while hovering over a screen button.
                    Whenever a user clicks on an object button to create it, the member variable "degrees" (of 
                    rotation) is initialized to zero so that normal objects (other than the receptor) will 
                    effectively have an instantiated identity rotation, while the receptor still has the ability
                    to be instantiated with a custom rotation.  This method also saves the original location and 
                    rotation of the object's button in order to place back in the menu. It is determined if the
                    "Cell Membrane" exists at this point as well.  If so, that object is saved as "cellMembrane"
                    for use in other methods, if not, then "null" is saved.  This ensures that it's not called 
                    repeatedly during the many "OnMouseDrag" method calls.

                    Cell Membrane is in the world. "guidePosition" is a temporary position variable used for 
                    keeping track of where the mouse is. The function "Camera.main.ScreenToWorldPoint" gets the 
                    mouse coordinates and converts them to world coordinates. The "spawnedObject" position is there 
                    because each object has a certain "Z" height or depth associated with it. Also, since 
                    the objects will be spawned at "camera height" the "+1" is so the object will be in front of 
                    the camera instead of on the same level.
