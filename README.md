# BioRubeBot

#### About This Project
This project is an ongoing development of an education Biology game focused on biological cellular activity.

Dr. Sara Cline, Professor of Biology at Athens State University, envisioned a game that would introduce individuals to biological cellular activity.  BioRubeBot is an educational application developed to entertain and educate young and old alike.  Game play is designed to simulate the cellular Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase signalling process (MAP-K).

### Notes to the developers

Developers that work on this project will **NOT** have access to making changes to master.

### How to Build the Game Locally
1. Navigate to the most current version in GitHub
   * Based on current knowledge, the most up-to-date repository is:
     https://github.com/BioRubeBotProject/Summer-2017/tree/master/biorubebot-dev-master
2. Use command `git clone <link-from-URL-above>`
3. Make note of the location that the repository is downloaded to.
4. Download Unity Version `2018.3.2f1`
5. Open Unity after verifying it is the aforementioned version
6. Select the open icon at the top right of the Unity window
7. Select the path from Step 3
   * It may be required to "Switch Target" based on the OS being developed on


### Notes to developers
It is recommended to make two primary branches for the duration of your team
1. Create a "production/pseudo-master" branch labeled `<Term(ex:Fall, Spring, Summer)><Year>-Production`, for example `Spring2019-Production`
2. Create a "staging" branch labeled `<Term(ex:Fall, Spring, Summer)><Year>-Dev`, for example `Spring2019-Dev`

The `-Production` branch will be used as the submission branch at the end of the semester.

The `-Dev` branch will be used to bring together your teams changes *after testing has been done on individual branches* so that all teammates can have the current, working development branch.

Team members should also make unique branches for each feature to be worked on so that neither the `-Dev` or `-Production` branches become corrupted with potentially bad code.

It is suggested to follow the standard git practice of building individual feature branches.
Feature branches similarly mock story names as each branch should accomplish a story.

The Project is currently compiled under Unity Version 2018.3.2f1.
